/*
 * The "mtest" command will totally trash the system, if the address
 * U-Boot is running from (starting at CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE) is included the
 * range of memory we are testing. We ensure here that the "default"
 * range that "mtest" uses is not stupid!
 * This is done only as a compile-time test.
 *
 * Currently, there are several macros which define where SDRAM
 * starts, how big it is, and where various things in RAM are located.
 * Unfortunately, it is possible to define these different
 * macros such that the overall set is mutually inconsistent!
 * In the future, it should be a goal to define only TWO of these
 * macros, and derive all the others automatically. To this end
 * the following code will issue compile-time diagnostics, if
 * the proposed derivations would fail!
 *
 * The two essential macros to be defined:
 *	CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_BASE, CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_SIZE
 *
 * Derived Macros:
 *	CONFIG_SYS_LOAD_ADDR		= CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_BASE
 *	CONFIG_SYS_MEMTEST_START	= CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_BASE
 *	CONFIG_SYS_MEMTEST_END		= CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE - CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_LEN - 1MiB
 *	CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE		= CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_BASE + CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_SIZE - 1MiB
 *	CONFIG_SYS_SE_SDRAM_WINDOW	= CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_SIZE - 1
 *
 * Note: Both 1MiB figures above are probably "too safe", and
 * could (if needed) be reduced somewhat.
 *
 * The 1MiB figure in CONFIG_SYS_MEMTEST_END really only needs to be
 * CONFIG_SYS_GBL_DATA_SIZE plus the size of the maximum stack size!
 * Where CONFIG_SYS_GBL_DATA_SIZE could be reduced to be exactly:
 * sizeof(gd_t) + sizeof(bd_t), removing the "small hole" in the
 * memory map. However, using 1MiB should be uber-conservative.
 * It is essential that "mtest" does not trash the stack!
 *
 * The 1MiB figure in verifying CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE, is just a "nice round number".
 * It could probably be reduced to be just the size of the raw u-boot.bin
 * binary image, plus the size of the (zero-initialized) ".bss" section!
 * However, having it over-sized is very convenient, as it means the
 * entry point is always just 1MiB below the "top of RAM".
 *
 * It is recommended that all include/config/<board>.h files
 * use the following two definitions:
 *
 *	#define CONFIG_SYS_MEMTEST_START	CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_BASE
 *	#define CONFIG_SYS_MEMTEST_END		(CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE - CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_LEN - (1 << 20))
